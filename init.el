;;; Code:

;; preable, load package manager (builtin)
(require 'package)

;; configure package package manager to use melpa and org repos
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/"))
                         
;; initialize package manager
(package-initialize)

;; the rest of this uses use-package to manage loading and configuring
;; packagess. if use-package isn't installed go fetch and install
;; it. this is super easy because our just configured package manager
;; can fetch use package for us.
(when
    (not package-archive-contents)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))

;; magit is so important we load it here rather than in
;; configuration.el
(use-package magit
  :ensure t
  :commands magit-status magit-blame
  :init
  (setq magit-auto-revert-mode nil
        magit-last-seen-setup-instructions "1.4.0")
  :bind (("s-g" . magit-status)
         ("s-b" . magit-blame)))

;; load our real configuration
(load ( expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/configuration.el"))

;;; init.el ends here
